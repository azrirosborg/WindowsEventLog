# WindowsEventLog
Native Windows Event Log from Java as Java Logger

This project implements a EventLog class which will log to 
to your Microsoft Windows EventLog by using JNA as bridge
between Java and Windows. This code project is not portable
and will not work on a Linux platform. It is Windows centric.
